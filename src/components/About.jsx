      <h2>About this grove</h2>
      <p>
        This is a calm, animated sanctuary inspired by forest fairies. Here you will find stories, resources, and a trusted catalog of doctors. We use a purple-green palette and soft glows reminiscent of bioluminescent mushrooms and twilight canopies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything you add is stored safely in a database-backed backend so your posts, resources, and doctors persist across visits.
